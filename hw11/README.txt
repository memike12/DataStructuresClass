I enjoyed this homework. I really like using the tools that java has
to offer. I used TreeMap PriorityQueue, ArrayList and List during this
homework. I basically implemented a BFS to begin with and it worked
will but then ran into problems converting to Dijkstra's
Algorithm. Right now my program says that it cannot compare two
different vertexes but I want it to compare my tuples. I'm sure that
it is a simple fix but I can't figure out how to make that happen. 

One big problem that I am running into is that I am calling things in
things and all of my calls to get my vertexes are super hard to
read. I think that looks really dirty but haven't figured out a way to
do it any differently.
