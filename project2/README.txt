I decided to implement a hash Table because setting and getting the words into the structure are very fast in a hash table. I also wanted to figure out how to get a hash table to work. That was honestly my biggest motivating factor. 

I discussed different parts of the project with Emily Phillips and Kieren Dziallo. 

I enjoyed this project a lot. It was full of ups and downs, at one point my hash table got done running in .38 seconds but only had 90 points on the oneplayer 0 so I decided to track down what was messing up. I realized that when I made my array bigger some words were getting left out some how so I fixed my seperate chaning and I ended up getting the same amount of point you did but now it runs at about 3.1 seconds. That was a bummer but speed doesn't outweigh accuracy.
