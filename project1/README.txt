/** Michael Moore m164488

I got through most the steps. I had a lot of trouble because my
computer was taken away becasue of bed bugs and I have to use a loner
computer which is pretty terrible. 

I enjoyed the project and would have accomplished more if I realized
how hard it would be to get the files I made off my computer and onto
the michaelson network. I didn't budget enough time for that.

I am still having trouble with generics I think I have quite a few
redundant casts.
